# Skenario

Skenario is a simulator toolkit for HPA. It was originally created to assist
with Knative Autoscaler development. Then Skenario was made HPA oriented. 

See [the Concepts document](docs/concepts.md) for a discussion of how Skenario is designed.

See "[Implement workload simulator for autoscaler development](https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/1686)"
for background and notes.

## Web GUI Usage

First, launch the server:

```
$ go run cmd/skenario/main.go
```

Then go to [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to see the user interface.

Adjust parameters using the form and click "Execute simulation" to submit the parameters to the server process.
When the simulation is complete, a graph of the results will be displayed.

The server stores simulation results in `skenario.db`. To suppress this behaviour, make Run in memory field 
checked in the user interface.

When you are finished, `Ctrl-C` to kill the running server.
